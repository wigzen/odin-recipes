        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I made this after trying different methods over a few years. It all came together so well. The flavor and texture was amazing. You really need to add water at the end and not be scared that it will ruin the dish, it will not! You need a fairly runny consistency for the best pav bhaji. Garnish with fresh chopped tomatoes, onions, and fresh cilantro if desired. Serve with toasted white bread or bread rolls.
